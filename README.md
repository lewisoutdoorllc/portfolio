I enhanced this site to help the user generate a random password as needed so the user can provide better security per there request. You can choose a password between
8-128 caracters and you have the choice to include uppercase, lowercase, number, and/or symbols. This also provides a number of other varibles by having a built in
generator to make the password even more random.
